# Cyrcle-Fitter

Is a very simple circle fitter that uses the Gauss-Newton (Least Squares) method to transform the randomly created 2D data points into a circle in the plane. I used the partial derivative for this. No additional libraries are required.

I will definitely write an update at a later date, as it seems a bit confusing at the moment.
