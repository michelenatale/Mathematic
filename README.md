## Circle-Fitter

Is a very simple circle fitter that uses the Gauss-Newton (Least Squares) method to transform the randomly created 2D data points into a circle in the plane. I used the partial derivative for this. No additional libraries are required.

## Galois Field or Finite Field

[Galois Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field), or [Finite Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field), possess finite mathematical structures. It is a set of numbers that consists of a finite number of elements and has two main operations, [addition and multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic), which follow very specific rules.
