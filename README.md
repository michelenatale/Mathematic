## Circle-Fitter

Is a very simple circle fitter that uses the Gauss-Newton (Least Squares) method to transform the randomly created 2D data points into a circle in the plane. I used the partial derivative for this. No additional libraries are required.

## Galois Field or Finite Field

Is a very simple [Galois Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field), or [Finite Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) calculator with the base 2 (Generator, Character), which has two main operations, [addition and multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic). All other operators (subtraction, division, inverse, etc.) are operations that follow very specific mathematical rules and are therefore legitimate.

## Big Primes Async-Await Generator

A very fast cryptographically secure generator for very big primes numbers based on the producer-consumer principle.
