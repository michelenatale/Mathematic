#Galois Field or Finite Field

[Galois field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field), or [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field), possess finite mathematical structures. It is a set of numbers that consists of a finite number of elements and has two main operations, [addition and multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding), which follow very specific rules.

Galois fields are used in mathematics (number theory etc.) as well as in computer science (cryptography and coding theory etc.). 

The Galois field shown here has a fixed generator = 2 (also known as a character). Galois fields can be extended with any natural number. For joint calculations, however, they must have the same order (e.g. 2^8).

The following parameters are required to create a Galois field.
- Generator (fixed = 2),  
- Exponent,
- order
