#Galois Field or Finite Field

[Galois Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field), or [Finite Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field), possess finite mathematical structures. It is a set of numbers that consists of a finite number of elements and has two main operations, [addition and multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic), which follow very specific rules.

Galois Fields are used in mathematics ([number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory) etc.) as well as in computer science ([cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and [coding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory) etc.). 

The Galois Field shown here has a fixed generator = 2 (also known as a character). Galois Fields can be extended with any natural number. For joint calculations, however, they must have the same order (e.g. 2^8).

The following [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic) are required to create a Galois Field.
- Generator (fixed = 2),  
- Exponent,
- order
